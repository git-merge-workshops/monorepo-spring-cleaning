</p>

> This workshop is a hands-on session to help you clean up your monorepo. We will be using popular open source tools to discover and clean up your monorepo.


## :mega: Prerequisites
There are 2 options for running this workshop:

### 1. Codespaces w/ linux monorepo
Within this repository, click on the `Code` button and select `Open with Codespaces`. This will open a new Codespace with all the tools you need to run this workshop.

### 3. Local w/ BYOM (Bring Your Own Monorepo)
If you don't have Docker installed, you can run the workshop locally, you will need to install the following tools:
### Tools
- Git 2.34 or newer
  - [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
  - [MacOS](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
  - [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- git filter-repo
- git-sizer 

# If you also do not have a monorepo of your own, you may also clone the linux monorepo
# NOTE: This will take a while to download...
- Clone torvalds/linux
```bash
git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux
```

## :mag: Activity 1: Analyse 

### Gathering overall stats with `git-sizer`
For the first activity, we will be using git-sizer to analyse the state of your monorepo. git-sizer is a tool that will help you understand the size of your repository and identify large files and commits.

Navaigate to the monorepo directory and run the following command:
```bash
git sizer
```

What simple information from this table can we gather immediately from this table?

1. 
```bash
| Overall repository size      |           |                                |
| * Commits                    |           |                                |
|   * Count                    |  1.08 M   | **                             |
|   * Total size               |   858 MiB | ***                            |
```
Commit count is synonymous with  ```bash git log --oneline | wc -l```. 
This is the overall number of commits in a repo. Total size is the uncompressed size of all the commits in the repo.
The overall repository size in general is a good indicator of how expensive certain traversal operations 
(such as fetch and clone) will perform on the repository. 

2. 
```bash
| Biggest objects              |           |                                |
| * Commits                    |           |                                |
|   * Maximum size         [1] |  72.7 KiB | *                              |
|   * Maximum parents      [2] |    66     | ******                         |
| * Trees                      |           |                                |
|   * Maximum entries      [3] |  2.42 k   | **                             |
| * Blobs                      |           |                                |
|   * Maximum size         [4] |  15.7 MiB | *                              |
```
The maximum blob size indicates the largest single file that exists in any single commit in a repository's history.
We can determine that 

3. 
```bash
| Biggest checkouts            |           |                                |
| * Number of directories  [5] |  4.92 k   | **                             |
| * Maximum path depth     [6] |    13     | *                              |
| * Maximum path length    [7] |   134 B   | *                              |
| * Number of files        [5] |  75.1 k   | *                              |
| * Total size of files    [5] |  1.03 GiB | *                              |
```

In addition to the table, git-sizer also displays the SHAs and commit paths of the largest git objects.

```

These SHAs or paths can be used to investigate problem files in a repository. 
For example, `git cat-file` can be used to view the contents of the largest blob in the repository.
In this case, we can view the contents of a header file. 
```bash
git cat-file -p 25875aa71dfefd1959f07e626c4d285b88b27ac2:drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/nbio/nbio_7_2_0_sh_mask.h | head -50

### Gathering blob sizing with git filter-repo
For the second activity, we will be using git filter-repo to determine and analyse large blobs in a repository.
While the main purpose of `git filter-repo` is to rewrite history, it can also be used to gather information about blobs in your repository.

### Note: this command may take a while to run... for simplicity, please consider using 
Navaigate to the monorepo directory and run the following command:
```bash
git filter-repo --analyze
```
Within the repository, navigate to the `.git/filter-repo/analysis`

```bash
cd .git/filter-repo/analysis
```

You will notice a handful of files, but the one we are interested in for now is the `blobs-shas-and-path.txt` file.
Open the file
```bash
code blobs-shas-and-path.txt
```

You will notice a large list of files
```bash
=== Files by sha and associated pathnames in reverse size ===
Format: sha, unpacked size, packed size, filename(s) object stored as

Let's break down what we are seeing here:

- `sha` refers to the SHA of the git object itself. We an use this to do things such as list the contents of the blob, 
- `unpacked size` refers to the decompressed size of the blob in bytes. This is the size of the file as it would be if it were extracted from the git repository. (i.e. upon running `git checkout`)
- `packed size` refers to the compressed size of the blob in bytes. This is the size of the file as it is stored in the git repository.
- `filename(s)` refers to the path of the file within the repository. If the file is located in multiple places, it will be listed as a comma separated list.

With this information, we can now determine the largest blobs in the repository history, and investigate them further. One example may be that we want to find which particular commit a large file was introduced. We can do this by running the following command:

```bash 
git log --follow --diff-filter=A drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/nbio/nbio_7_2_0_sh_mask.h

    Add registers for NBIO 7.0
    
    Signed-off-by: Alex Deucher <alexander.deucher@amd.com>
```
And we can verify and see all files that were added in this commit by running the following command:

```bash
git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r c4dc7b1a54a043d08172f2d3de02578667a7595c
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/raven1/NBIO/nbio_7_0_default.h
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/raven1/NBIO/nbio_7_0_offset.h
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/raven1/NBIO/nbio_7_0_sh_mask.h
```

You will notice that in some cases, a filename is listed multiple times. This indicates that changes to the file have been commited multiple times in the history of the repository. For large files (in particular large, compressed binary files), this can be problematic as large binaries do not tend to compress nor diff well. 



### Rewriting History with git filter-repo
Now that we have gathered information on our large files, lets see how we can rewrite history to remove them. We will use the `git filter-repo` tool for this.

In our example, let's propose that we want to remove all instances of the file `drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/nbio/nbio_7_2_0_sh_mask.h` from the repository history. `git filter-repo` allows us to pass in a single path, or a list of paths to remove from the repository history. We can do this by running the following command:

```bash
git filter-repo --path drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/nbio/nbio_7_2_0_sh_mask.h
```

Your output should resemble something like this:
```bash
git filter-repo --force --path drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/nbio/nbio_7_2_0_sh_mask.h

```

This will remove all instances of the file from the repository history. We can verify this by running the same command from early to output the first commit the file was introduced in:

```bash
git log --follow --diff-filter=A drivers/gpu/drm/amd/include/asic_reg/nbio/nbio_7_2_0_sh_mask.h
```

After performing a`git filter-repo` will also output a list of rewritten shas. This can be useful for any implementations that specifically reference commits by their sha.

```

### Git replace
Rewriting history can be expensive, time consuming, and is not always the correct solution. An organization may be so heavily invested in their monorepo, that a rewrite is totally unrealistic `git replace` is a useful tool for rewriting history. Given a particular commit SHA, it allows you to replace a commit in history with another commit.
